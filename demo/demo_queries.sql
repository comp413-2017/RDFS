---------- QUERY 1 ----------:
---- PROBLEM: What are the populations of all the countries that are not independent in 2010?

select c.name as country, p.value as population, c.is_independent

---------- QUERY 2 ----------:
---- PROBLEM: How many male students come from countries that are not independent?

from dim_student as s

---------- QUERY 3 ----------:
